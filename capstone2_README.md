# Predicting DNA Type and Taxon from Codon and Amino Acid Frequencies

## Background

Nucleotides encode amino acids in blocks of three, called codons.  The four distinct nucleotides produce 64 possible codons, which do not occur with equal frequency; this is codon usage bias.

A preprint paper - ['Codon usage bias levels predict taxonomic identity and genetic composition'](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.26.356295v1.full) - applied various ML models to predict taxon and DNA type from codon frequencies.  This project repeats this work, and extends it by also using amino acid frequencies as predictors.
