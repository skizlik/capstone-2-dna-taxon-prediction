# Predicting DNA Type and Taxon from Codon and Amino Acid Frequencies

## Background

Nucleotides encode amino acids in blocks of three, called codons.  The four distinct nucleotides produce 64 possible codons, which do not occur with equal frequency; this is codon usage bias.

A preprint paper - ['Codon usage bias levels predict taxonomic identity and genetic composition'](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.26.356295v1.full) - applied various ML models to predict taxon and DNA type from codon frequencies.  This project repeats this work, and extends it by also using amino acid frequencies as predictors.

Data from this study were made freely available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Codon+usage.  These data were [wrangled](/Capstone%202%20Data%20Wrangling%20v%201.ipynb) and [preprocessed](/Capstone%202%20Pre-Processing.ipynb) to remove sparse categories and encode amino acid frequencies.
